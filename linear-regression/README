In this task, I perform file reading in a similar way for both CSV and regular files as follows: I read line by line until the end of the file, ensuring that at each iteration I split the respective line, check each element individually to determine if it is a string or if it can be converted to a number, and then transform it into a double. Afterward, I insert the first element of each line into column Y and the rest into the matrix (for the CSV file, I make sure to skip the first line and read until the end of the file). Once I have formed the InitialMatrix, I am ready to construct the FeatureMatrix in the following way: I traverse the entire matrix and check each element individually. If it is "yes," I insert 1 into the FeatureMatrix; if it is "no," I insert 0; if it is a number, I insert it as is; and if it is "furnished," "unfurnished," or "semi-furnished," I use a counter that represents an additional step compared to traversing the InitialMatrix column, inserting elements of 0 or 1 in the specific case.

With this matrix, I can determine the specific coefficients of the model by implementing the requirements from the formula or the conjugate gradient algorithm (where A represents the FeatureMatrix multiplied by its transpose, b represents the transpose of the FeatureMatrix multiplied by the column vector Y, and x_0 is a column of zeros with the same dimension as Y). After these implementations, I will be able to compute the cost functions using the formulas provided in the task, relying on an "h" that represents the predicted value.
